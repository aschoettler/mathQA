# Welcome to my Math Website
This is my collection of explanations and problem solutions to math problems
that I've written up to help explain various mathematical topics and concepts.
Most problems here are from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

## My Favorite Problems:

### Envelope Curve Problems
Take a straight line and move the ends just a little bit according to a basic rule.
When repeated indefinitely a curve emerges, explored here.
* [Link](envelope/curve.html) to the basic problem.

### Half-spaces and Standard Form of Liner Equations
* Explanation of standard form of a line, and a **lot** of related geometry.
* [Link](halfspace-3-4-24/halfspace.html)

### Dot Products and Angles
* Dot products and relation to cosines
* [Link](dot-product-vs-cosine/dot-product-vs-cosine.html)

### Arc Length
* Explanation of arc length formula and intuition
* [Link](arclength/arclength.html)

## Other problems
* Diceroll
  * This was a question asked on reddit somewhere.
  * Here's a [Link](diceroll/diceroll.html) to an answer I made.
* Riemann Sum Example
